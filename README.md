===========
Game is called "Snap"
*First you need a deck of cards and two players.
*Deck needs to include 4 suits, 13 ranks per suit and 52 cards total.
*Shuffle and deal the cards - each player gets half the deck.  
*First player puts a card on the pile, second player adds card on top, repeat until the two cards have matching ranks. 
*If they match, the first player to call "snap" gets all the cards in the pile. 
*Pile is now empty again. 
*Game goes on until either one player has all the cards (winner) or they have reached the maximum amount of rounds.
